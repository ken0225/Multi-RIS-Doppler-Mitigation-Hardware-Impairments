# Multi-RIS-Doppler-Mitigation-Hardware-Impairments

**Disclaimer**: The simulation code is licensed under the GPLv2 license and is delivered as it is. I encourage you to reuse the code in your research, but I cannot give any support. The readme file contains the instructions on how to run the code. As soon as you edit the code, you are on your own. My GitHub page is the only way that I am sharing simulation code, so there is no need to send me emails and ask for code related to other papers. The code is either openly available for everyone or it is not available at all.

This is part of the code for the paper "Positioning Information Based High-Speed Communications with Multiple RISs: Doppler Mitigation and Hardware Impairments" by Ke Wang, Chan-Tong Lam, and Benjamin K. Ng.

The code will be completed very soon.
